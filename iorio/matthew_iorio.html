      <h4>Graphics</h4>
      <p>Visually, Just Cause 4 does look good, but it does have imperfections. Overall I am still pretty happy with it, and I did find myself failing to notice some of the imperfections I was seeing when I started. (For what it is worth, before starting on this review I was working on a project that requires carefully examining images, so I might have been primed for imperfections.)

The main imperfection to spot would be the hard transition between different level-of-detail (LOD) distances, which is not uncommon in open world games. I think Just Cause 4 may have it worse than some because of how easy and intended it is for players to fly around the map. There is a height range where part of the ground is within the nearer LOD distances, so you get more of the grass and other objects there than the rest of the ground. If you are above this, the issue is nonexistent and you really can enjoy the visuals. Actually I am somewhat impressed by how much is shown at great distance, making the views while flying with the wingsuit really awesome. Although I did notice that sometimes objects I had destroyed were being shown when I was far away, only to disappear as I approached. Not exactly ideal, but then after destroying everything in an area, why would you look back, and at the right distance to notice this? As it is I think I only observed this once and you would need to check the review playthrough to find if it happened more than that one time.

A lot of the game looks very good, including each of the biomes and the weather events you can end up in. Also the various objects, vehicles, and weapons look very good. The explosions might be a little blown out at times, but then I guess that can be part of the fun too; having such a bright ball of fire you cannot make out all of the detail. Even with that, the explosions and fire still look good enough.</p>
      <h5>Release Information</h5>
      <p>The Just Cause 4 release date is December 4. The release date was announced at Microsoft’s E3 conference in 2018, and confirms that Rico Rodriguez will return later this year.</p>

      <h8>Conclusion</h8>
      <p>Just Cause 4's traversal system is wonderfully entertaining, and the chaotic, explosion-sim physics in play are frequently exhilarating, which is why it is one of the best games to play on your free time.</p>
