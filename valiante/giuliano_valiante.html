    <p> NBA Live 19 is a great game for basketball lovers. The game has vastly improved compared to last years model, NBA Live 18, however there are still some things that could be done to perfect users’ gaming experience such as; improve player appearance graphics and commentator dialogue which is boring and average at the moment. The Ultimate Team Online feature still isn’t at the level gamers are wishing for. New cards and updates have been added, but the mode still doesn’t qualify to be enjoyed by most users. The game has risen to a respectable level, can be an amusing game, nonetheless its flaws hurt the realism and longevity of the gameplay, pushing the game away from that elite category of elite EA sports games. </p>

    <p> Gives you the ability to customize and make decisions for your entire playing experience, from in game plays to off the court interviews. It is like a career mode centered on your player. Your player can develop better ratings and icon abilities as you progress throughout the season. The game contains a new journey and different story from previous career mode scenarios. You can also unlock special rewards such as signature throwback jerseys, shoes and specific player animations that make your player look and play differently during the game. </p>

    <div id="Court Battles Text">
    <p> An all new way to play competitive basketball in numerous courts with custom rules. In this game mode you challenge others while you set up defenses on your own home court to defend it. It is somewhat of a campaign mode. The goal is to win, take as many courts as possible and gain as much Court Hype as possible. Court Hype is a ranking of how successful you’ve been in the mode. Your achievement status ranges from Rookie to Icon (being the best). Defending your court is divided into four steps: choosing your court’s rules, setting your court’s defensive lineup, choosing an attacker handicap and setting your team’s game plan. Courts you can attack are those automatically recommended to you, your friends’ courts or those who have recently attempted to take your court. </p>

    <p> The League mode is when you get drafted by an NBA team and you begin to play league games with your new teamates. The league has a modern and unique perspective on an everyday basketball career. In this mode, basketball is so much more than sold-out arenas, sponsors and jerseys. It’s all about the emotion in hitting late Game 7 game winners and all the hype that comes with the fame. This game mode is all about growing your players and taking your teams deep in the playoffs. The decisions you make with your pro player can influence the trajectory of your career and even your personal life. The narrative system has vastly improved from last years game. This year’s version of The League is a lot more rewarding in terms of decisions. Those decisions now also lead into the game for example when you play certain players or certain teams. </p>

The challenges and rewards are simply endless. At times stake could be high, trying to impress, as your game is being broadcasted to the entire social media world. Their are Live Events that give you the opportunity to win exclusive and rare sneakers and threads. This game mode can be played solo or with friends. </p>
