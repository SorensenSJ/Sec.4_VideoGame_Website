      <p> Farpoint is one of the first games developed for PlayStation VR that feels like more than a tech demo, a proof of concept, or a traditional game with VR features slapped on as an afterthought. That works to its advantage, because while it would be a mediocre shooter if you played it on a normal screen, in VR it feels good, especially when you play with the new PlayStation VR Aim Controller.</p>
      <p> Like any good VR game, Farpoint makes concessions for the limitations of virtual reality. For example, in story missions enemies only ever come at you from the front, which lets you play the whole game without having to turn around much. By traditional shooter standards it’s boring design, but in Farpoint it helps stave off the motion sickness some people experience in VR and avoids issues with moving outside the bounds of where the PlayStation Camera can detect you or your controller (which can be a DualShock or the gun-shaped Aim). And unlike something like The London Heist or Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, Farpoint doesn’t feel like a simplistic shooting gallery because you can move around its environments freely. There’s also a wide variety of foes that behave intelligently in combat, and big levels that encourage you to pop from cover to cover as your enemies gain ground and try to flank you. </p>
      <p> What makes Farpoint noteworthy is the phenomenal feel of its gunplay. There’s a deeply satisfying rhythm to handling these guns, and you see their intricate moving parts clicking and sliding as you methodically empty their chambers, tap the reload button, and physically tip the Aim Controller up and back toward your shoulder to swap back and forth between your two equipped guns. But the highlight is hefting the surprisingly light Aim Controller (or a DualShock, clumsily) up to your face and closing one eye to line up your weapons’ sights feels intuitive, snappy, and natural – it’s better than any other shooter I’ve played in VR. </p>

      <p> The precision rifle and shotgun in particular feel like a match made in heaven, perfectly complementing one another as you snipe distant jetpack-wearing aliens and pull the shotgun out in panic when leaping spiders pop out of the ground in front of you. With a utilitarian rocket-equipped assault rifle and a less useful alien plasma rifle and spike launcher (very much in the vein of Halo’s Needler) rounding out the selection Farpoint could have used more weapon variety, but it nails the basics so well that it’s easy to recommend for that alone. </p>
