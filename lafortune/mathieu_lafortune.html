  <h2> Game Review </h2>
The game starts off with 100 players in the battle bus where you can deploy yourself anywhere on the map, you then have to find guns, ammo, shields and bandage and prepare to fight to become the only person left on the map. Also in this game there is building with 3 different materials, wood, brick and metal. Building is an essential part of fortnite and is the building blocks of this game. Although building is the most important part of the game there is also alot of glitches in the game like going through walls and gets other players very upset.
