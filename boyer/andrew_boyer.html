      <h3> A little about the game </h3>
       <p>  Club Penguin was an online-based, massively multiplayer online role-playing game (abbreviated as a MMORPG) created by Disney Canada Inc. (previously New Horizons Interactive) in the summer of 2005. It had a public Beta Testing in August 2005, and was officially launched on October 24, 2005. It was later bought by Disney in August 2007. It involved a virtual world, where the players were penguins, and was featuring a large range of minigames and other online activities, and was based on a snowy island, after which the game was named.
Club Penguin has been noted as sharing similarities with other popular browser-based online environments such as RuneScape and Habbo Hotel, such as the use of an in-game currency to purchase virtual items and pets, named "puffles". The game was specifically designed for players within the ages of 6-14 (however all ages can play), thus child safety was a vital responsibility of the game's developers. The game was founded by Lance Priebe, and co-founded by Lane Merrifield, and Dave Krysko. There were over 330,000,000 penguin accounts created and played in over 190 countries. It was estimated that over 150 million people worldwide played Club Penguin.</p>

    <h4> Personal Top 5 Minigames You Could Play </h4>
      <div class= "Top 5 Minigames">
        <ul>
          <li id="1. Card-Jitsu"> 1.Card-Jitsu- My number one top pick for a minigame in Club Penguin would have to be the martial arts battles, also know as Card-Jitsu. The reason it is called Card-Jitsu is because the battles were an elemental card game between the elements of snow, water, and fire. Through many battles, you could earn various belt levels, going from white belt to black belt (there is also the rank of ninja, which you obtained when you defeated the sensei for the first time, but only after having obtained all previous belts). Power-Cards were powerful cards that could deal game-altering effects like: preventing your opponent to use a certain element, dealing a large amount of damage, etc. every Power-Card also had its own animation.</li>
          
          <li id="2. Sled-Racing"> 2.Sled-Racing- In second would be the Sled-Racing minigame that you could go to when "going up the ski lift". in the Ski Village, in the northwest corner of the island. The Ski Hill had four tracks, each progressively more dangerous: Bunny Hill, and Express, Penguin Ruin, and Ridge Run. There was also a Test Track, which was the most dangerous of all, and was only accessible in missions. Additionally, a Game Upgrades catalog was located here, which sold different kinds of sleds. Races could vary from 2 racers up to 4. </li> 
          
          <li id="3. Elite Penguin Force Missions"> 3. The Elite Penguin Force- The Everyday Phoning Facility was a building in Club Penguin, located at the Ski Village. It served as a cover for the Elite Penguin Force base, the EPF Command Room, under the guise of an office building. There were various desks with computers, and other various objects that would be seen in an average office. The room was the cover for the Elite Penguin Force after the Penguin Secret Agency ceased operations. Originally, it was just a gray, empty room, with a lone phone booth and pillars in all four corners of the room, one of which opened up to reveal an elevator to the agency headquarters, and three others were part of a test. After the renovation of August 8, 2013, this room served as an office where penguins could work, and also as a phone directory service. In order to unlock the secret door to enter the agency(before it qas renovated), you needed to pass "The Test". First you had to simply throw a snowball on a target on a wall. After this, the pillar in the lower right corner would rise and a green panel would appear and players would need to go onto it, once on it for a few seconds, the lower left pillar would rise and you would need to "run" to it as fast as you could. Once the panel had been run on to, the third part of the test involved stealth. In this, 2 cameras would appear and you have to hide from them, but if you threw snowballs onto the cameras woul could create a blind spot and hide successfully, if not, you would be spotted. The final part of the test, which involved mental abilities. Here, the upper left pillar would raise, revealing a blue panel. Players were instructed to stand on it. However, if stood on, electric bars would trap the player. After this, they would have one minute to escape. By throwing a snowball at the fuse box on the lower right pillar, players would disable the cage, and be freed. If this option was taken, points would be deducted. If players did not escape from the cage in under a minute, points would be deducted further. However, if players did not step on the blue panel at all, threw a snowball at the blue panel first, or threw a snowball at the fuse box without stepping on the panel, they would receive full points. After all four tasks had been completed, the secret door to the EPF Command Room would appear.Once inside the Command Room, you could do a vaariety of things like throw snowballs onto targets, make bubbles in the water jug, but most importantly, you could partake in top secret missions, the missions had a WIDE variety; from helping an old lady find her lost puffle to defeating an evil polar bear that was trying to melt the Club Penguin iceberg.</li>
          
          <li id="4. Cart Surfing"> 4. Cart Surfer- Cart Surfer was a Club Penguin minigame that could be played in the Mine. The main objective of the game was the performance of various tricks and stunts to earn points (similar to Catchin' Waves) while riding a Mine Cart on a track. When players finished the game, they were brought to the Mine Shack. This was one of the most popular games in Club Penguin, as it was a quick way to earn a great amount of coins, by using the right and best moves. An efficient player could earn about 450 coins, and if one had all of the stamps that went with this game, their score would be doubled.</li>
         
          <li id="5. Coffee Bag Catch"> 5. Bean Counters (which was the official name of this minigame) was a Club Penguin mini-game that could be played by clicking on the java bean bag in the Coffee Shop. In this game, the player had to catch flying bags full of coffee beans coming out of a truck, while avoiding flying objects. The player must have also loaded the bags onto a platform. You could not hold more than five coffee bean bags, as you would be crushed by weight and would lose a life. You could collect more lives as you advance in levels. There were five trucks to unload, therefore, there were five levels. If you finished all of them, you would receive an extra 60 coins added on to the amount of coins that you had already earned.</li>
