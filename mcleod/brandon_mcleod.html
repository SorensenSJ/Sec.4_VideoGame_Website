<h3>History of the Game</h3>
<p>
Donkey kong was one of the greatest games to known to man. This game first came into existence in the arcades in 1981. The game first
  started with Donkey Kong and by 1882 Donkey Kong Jr. came along. When the first version of the game came out, donkey Kong was
  known as the bad guy and Jumpman (soon to be called Mario) was known as the character who had to save his girlfriend Pauline (soon to be 
  called princess Peach). The idea for the name Kong came from the movie King Kong and the idea for the name Donkey was chosen because 
  Donkey apprentely means dumb or stupid in Japenenese.

<h3>Game Review</h3>
<p>
  This game is still being sold in many regions around the world. They have created several new versions of Donkey Kong that can now be 
played in all new consoles. Ever since its existence Donkey Kong has been popular and although the popularity of this game is decreasing
it is still being played among quite a few fellow gamers. This game can be found in several stores such as EB Games. I strongly 
  recommend this game to be bought and played for it is the greatest and one of the greatest games known to man.

<h3>How the Game is Played</h3>
<p>
  When the first version of the game came out it was fairly is to play. The character of which you were controlling was named Jumpman.
  The objective of the game was to dodge all barrels of which were thrown by Donkey Kong in order to rescue Jumpman's girlfriend, Pauline.
  You as the gammer had four specific controls which were to jump, move forward, move backwards and climp ladders.
