  <p>
    <em> <strong> FIFA Street 4 </strong> </em> is the fourth game of the "FIFA Street" series, made by EA Sports. The series is based on the street soccer played around the world. The cartoon-like graphics have been dropped, unlike the previous versions, for a more realistic look. The graphics and player mechanisms are like FIFA 12, which was also developed by the same team that made this game. The game is made to be fast-faced, as it is usually 5 or 6-a-side. This game also has at least 50 new tricks that were not included in <em> FIFA Street 3 </em>
