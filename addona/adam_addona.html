  <h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 Worth it?</h1>
  <h2>by Adam Addona</h2>
  <h2> What the game is about</h2>
 <p>America, 1899. The end of the Wild West era has begun. After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.</p>

<h1> Review </h1>
<p>Itâ€™s simply incredible how much Rockstar has accounted for. But even beyond the jaw-dropping graphics,and the gameplay, the story is something special and memorable. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a must-play for its entertainment value, its boundary-pushing, and its place as a landmark moment in video games.This game is by far the best game I've played in my life. Read Dead Redemption 2 is a game that took 8 years of development. When playing the game you quickly realize that this game was worth the wait. In the game you can do many different activities such as hunting, fishing, free roaming, completing missions, and much more.
