    <div class="Basic Info">
      <h2>Basic Info</h2>
      <p>Black Desert Online is arguably the forefront MMO RPG today. No other game rivals it's graphics, and highly responsive
         action system. When you start the game, you can choose from one of the many classes. This choice isn't final, and you can change your class
        later on. The options are: </p>
      <img id=classes src="images/BDO CLASSES.png">
      <ul>
         <li>Ranger: she uses a bow and is a high DPS ranged character.</li>
         <li>Warrior: he uses a greatsword, as has a great combination of offense and defense.</li>
         <li>Berserker: a grab heavy class that has a high damage potential while being incredibly tanky.</li>
         <li>Valkyrie: similar to warrior, a good combination of defense and offense, maybe a bit more defensive than warrior.</li>
         <li>Wizard: a ranged class, one of the best for mob grinding and essential in large scale fighting for his healing.</li>
         <li>Witch: another version of wizard, who uses differents elemental magic, with more range and damage but reduced viability.</li>
         <li>Sorceress: a difficult, quick and i-frame heavy class that is good at small scrimages. The very best difficult mob grinder.</li>
         <li>Dark Knight: a good class overall, with range, good damage, and a top tier grinder. Good for beginners.</li>
         <li>Maewha: a very fast and bursty class, outputs heavy damage with reduced tankiness.</li>
         <li>Musa: a male version of maewha, with more of a spinning and continuous damage outburst.</li>
         <li>Ninja: the very best 1v1 class, with his invisibility and highly concentrated big damage.</li>
         <li>Kunoichi: a female version of ninja, who has more defense and less damage potential.</li>
         <li>Striker: one of the best classes, very easy to play, with insane damage and tankiness. Fights hand to hand.</li>
         <li>Mystic: the female version of striker, with more defense and has a  very flowy style of play. Less rigid than striker.</li>
         <li>Tamer: good in 1v1s, but unfortunately not much else. She summons her pet, a Hellfang, to help her in battle.</li>
         <li>Archer: the newest class, the male version of ranger, not much is currently known, but he uses a greatbow, and is the only fully ranged class.</li>
         <li>Lahn: a popular class for her unique ability to fly, or glide. Good in skirmishes and 1v1 matchups.</li>
       </ul>
      <p>The basic content in the game is rather simple. There are quests, that involve exploring the world, interacting with NPCs and 
         killing monsters. There is grinding, which will likely be your main source of income in the game. Grinding is the act of killing
         mobs over and over and collecting the drops which you can then sell to make silver. The main focus and specialty of the game however,
         is the PvP content. There are 1v1s, 3v3 scrimages, and in the later game you and your guild can fight other guilds for territories
         and silver. Finally, the other main source of income is lifeskills. They are as follows: </p>
       <ul>
         <li>Gathering: gathering plants and materials from nature to use them in further concoctions.</li>
          <li>Cooking: creating meals that give different buffs for PvP or grinding.</li>
          <li>Trading: creating boxes of goods to sell across cities throughout the world.</li>
          <li>Training: horse training, taming and selling horses to other players.</li>
          <li>Processing: enhancing a base material into merchandise.</li>
          <li>Fishing: fishing and searching for expensive fish to sell to the market.</li>
          <li>Alchemy: creating elixirs that give useful buffs in battle and during grind sessions.</li>
          <li>Hunting: searching and hunting for strange beasts across the world, in unique and exotic lands.</li>
          <li>Farming: growing and harvesting base materials that can be sold or turned into trading crates.</li>
          <li>Sailing: travelling in your vessel throughout the oceans to explore islands. Does well when paired with fishing.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>The Community</h2>
    <img id=guild src="images/BDO GUILD.jpg">                     
     <p>The game's playerbase is rather large, especially on the NA and EU servers. While most players are helpful and friendly, trolls,
          karma-bombers and pranksters are common, and as a new player you should watch out. My recommendation is to join a guild as 
          soon as possible, one with an active community. They will be able to teach you about the game and what to do.</p>

    <div class="Experience">
       <h2>My Experience</h2>
       <p>My own experience with the game is an overall positive one. I have spent over 3000 hours in the game. While it can sometimes be 
          tedious, the fun you have with your friends and your guildmates will be worth it, no matter the numerous issues with game. 
           However, this game is not for the daunted. It WILL require a lot of work and effort put into it to achieve success within the game.
            Countless hours grinding for billions and billions of silver, or spending time in the Battle Arena, honing your PvP skills to get
           into a better siege guild. It truly is a lifestyle, and if you're not careful, it will consume you and your real life. But, if you manage
           that balance between the two, it will be an incredible experience.</p>
