  <p>
    For nearly 30 years, the Sid Meier's Civilization series has been defining the strategy game genre and for
good reason. The thought of building your own nation from ancient times to the modern day and
beyond while competing with others for world domination is an interesting idea and translates
beautifully as a video game. By far one of the series' best points is just how much content has been
added since it's beginning in 1991, whether it be new playable civilizations, completely redesigning
previous features or even making the game's presentation more updated, every Civilization game feels
way different and improved than the last. Civilization VI continues this trend and many find it to work
amazingly. Not a single playable civilization seems out of place here, whether you're trying to enforce
naval supremacy as the Congo or charging into Rome on your war elephant while being commanded by
a blood-thirsty Mahatma Gandhi, this game really allows for creativity in how you plan to shape your
empire for the future. But say taking over the world isn't on your to-do-list today, so instead you decide
to colonize another solar system or make your belief of the great chicken gods the world religion again
highlighting the flexibility you have as a player to win a game.
