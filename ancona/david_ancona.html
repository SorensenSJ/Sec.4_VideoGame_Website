    <h3> What is Kirby Super Star? </h3>
    <p> Bad guys are stealing food from Dreamland and you must play as kirby and defeat these villains. In kirby super star there are eight different games (as seen on the cover) and they all features various different games and styles of playing with the pink fluffball. There is springbreeze, in this game whispy woods thinks you are bothering the forest  where you go through 4 stages and get a chance to defeat whispy woods. Dynablade, where you go through level to eventually defeat dynablade the bird  that comes to attack you because it thinks you stole and ate its baby children. Megaton Punch where kirby tests his punching force on many different enemies using tiny minigames. You can race against King Dedede to a foot race in Gourmet Race while you eat food and dodge attacks.In the Great Cave Offensive kirby falls into a mine and his objective is to collect all of the treasures found, Samurai Kirby where you test your reaction by clicking a button when an ! point pops up and this happens against other enemies. Milky way wishes which features kirby battling against marx a fellow dreamlander and its sequel the arena. Finally revenge of metaknight (my personal favourite) is unlocked when the other games are beaten, in this mode you defeat meta knight and take down his ship, as the ship goes down meta knight challenges you to the duel and when you defeat him you beat the game.  </p>

    <h3> Final Review </h3>
    <h4> Graphics: </h4>
    <p>Kirby Super Star is an amazing game, although its 8 bit graphics are not too fun to look at, in the time of the SNES’ launch they were considered amazing compared to other more popular franchises.  </p>
<h4> Game/Mechanics: </h4>
  <p>The Kirby franchise is super unique. The game director Masahiro Sakurai, who is also the director of Super Smash Bros a really popular game among nintendo fans, never stops producing Kirby games with Kirby Star Allies releasing on the Nintendo Switch last year. The Super Star game features the unique ability to eat and become your enemies, to jump around, attack bosses and clear levels. It also features multiple game modes in one game which in that time was not something very common. Kirby was a cool character the enemies were cool and overall the game was not too hard to beat, this made the ideal game for anyone whether it be kids or teens, Kirby Super Star is fun for everyone.</p>
  <h4> Audio: </h4> 
    <p>Kirby Super Star music track, till this day is considered one of the best in all of the gaming world. You can occasionally hear people humming the tune of Gourmet Race anywhere you go another one of its great tracks is from revenge of metaknight, the epic battle music really shows how much effort and time was putting in designing the game.
