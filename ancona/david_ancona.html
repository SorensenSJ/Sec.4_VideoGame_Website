    <h3> What is Kirby Super Star? </h3>
    <p> Bad guys are stealing food from Dream Land and you must play as kirby and defeat these villans. 
      In kirby super star there aare eight different games (as seen on the cover) and they all features various different games and styles of playing with the bpink fluffball. 
      There is springbreeze, in this game whispy woods thinks you are bothering the forest  where you go throught 4 stages and get a chance to defeat whispy woods. 
      Dynablade, where you go throught level to eventually defeat dynablade the bird that comes to attack you because it thinks you stole and ate its baby children. Megatoon punch where kirby tests his punching force on many different enemies using tiny minigames. You can race against King Dedede to a foot race in Gourmet Race while you eat food and dodge attacks.In the Great Cave Offensive kirby falls into a mine and his objective is to collect all of the treasures found, Samurai Kirby where you test your reaction by clicking a button when an ! point pops up and this happens against other enemies. Milky way wishes which feautres kirby battling against marx a fellow dreamlander and its sequal the arena. Finally revenge of metaknight (my personal favourite) is unlocked when the other games are beaten, in this mode you defeat metaknight and take down his ship, as the ship goes down metaknight challenges you to the duel and when you defeat him you beat the game. </p>
