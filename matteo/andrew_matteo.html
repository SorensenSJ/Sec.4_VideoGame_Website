  <h1>A FIFA 19 Review</h1>
  <h3>By Andrew Matteo</h3>
  <body> "With a plethora of new modes and some significant gameplay tweaks that make ball control more convincing, FIFA 19 is a distinct improvement upon last year's effort. 
    Not all of these additions hit the mark, however, such as the Gears of War-style shooting mechanic and a handful of the new Kick-Off modes. 
    When coupled with an underbaked The Journey single-player campaign, those slow down its momentum a bit. 
    That said, FIFA 19s simply more fun than recent entries with a level of variety that should only increase its longevity."
    <strong>-Simon Cardy IGN 8.2/10</strong>

    A popular gamemode in the FIFA franchise is FIFA Ultimate Team or "FUT" as it's known by the community. FUT allows you to create your dream team,
  by earning coins to purchase these players off the transfer market. In FUT, coins are earned by playing matches, packing players in packs that can be purchased with coins or FIFA points and selling the players that have value,
  or even completing Squad Building Challenges that award you coins, players or even more packs to open and sell players!
  FIFA Ultimate Team even has a competitive gamemode named FUT Champions, where players compete with each other for the top spot and get rewarded with coins and packs.
