<h2>General Description</h2>
<p>Rules of Survival is considered to be the OG mobile battle royale game. it had lots of players early and it still does! it capped at 10 000 000 players worldwide. peopel from all over the world can team up to play the game and win with strategic game play. it is a battle royale game, meaning that there is an amout of people that start in the map and the last one or team standing wins! It allows for competetive and enjoyable gameplay.</p>

<h2>Controls and Description</h2>
<p>the controls arent great. if we were to considerit to a computer game, it would be lacking. however, going in to the review I didnt expect much with the controls considering it is a mobile game.</p>

<h2>Game Review and Rating</h2>
<p>Thanks to its awkward controls, this take on the popular battle royale kind of online shooter doesn't work as well as its computer and console counterparts. Like the wildly popular PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, Rules of Survival is a third-person, last-person-standing shooter in which you and 119 other online players get dropped into a war zone and, after (hopefully) locating weapons and armor, have to battle it out until only one person remains. As time goes on, the battlefield slowly shrinks -- being caught outside of it is deadly -- while the risk of being caught in a random bombing increases. But while this kind of Hunger Games-esque online shooter can be fun, it works much, much better when you have a controller and don't have to use the typically awkward controls that undermine nearly every third-person shooter on tablets. It also doesn't help that the battlefields are so large that it takes forever to find anyone to shoot: It's possible to go 5-10 minutes before you see any other players. The game also takes an unusually long time to load and occasionally suffers from glitches that make it stutter. Which is why Rules of Survival doesn't, well, rule.</p>
