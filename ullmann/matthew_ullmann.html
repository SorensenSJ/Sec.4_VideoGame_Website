        <h3> Rating 9/10 </h3>
        <p>This game deserves a 9 out of 10 because it contains a great
          story along with amazing gameplay. What really blows this game
          out of thr water is its stunning visuals. Things that make the
          game even better is its amusing multiplayer. What dosen't make this
          a perfect 10/10 is its bloated third act which is when the content 
          becomes a little repetitive from its previous 3 games.</p>

        <h3> Review </h3> 
        <p> Uncharted 4: A Theif's End is a remarkable acheivement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. 
          Though it's let down by a lack of immmagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that 
          drags on far too long. Uncharted 4 carries on the series' proud tradition of peerless polish and style, 
          wiht a great multiplayer component to boot.Most importantly, it's a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group 
          of characters we've known for nine years. A worthy thief's end, indeed. (IGN The Verdict)

        <h3> History of the Uncharted Series </h3>
        <p> In Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune, the first in the series, the protagonist Nathan Drake, supposed descendant of
      Sir Francis Drake, goes on the hunt to find the lost treasure of El Dorado in South America, with the help of
      his mentor Sully and girlfriend Elena Fisher. They become wanted by pirates, led by Eddy Raja and a group of 
      mercenaries led by Atoq Navarro. However, staring into the treasure that Drake desires, it can make a human 
      possessed by the demons/monster of the cursed treasure. <br> </br> In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, Nathan takes a journey across the Nepal and the Himalayas in the search of a
      deserted city, called Shambhala. Uncharted 2 consists of the same 3 people, but also a brand new character,
      Chloe Frazer, a new love interest who has had a history with Nathan. The second game also introduces a multiplayer
          mode to the series. <br> </br> Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception was released in November of 2011, on the Playstation 3 console. The story of this 
      game focuses on Nate and Sully on a mission to a legendary lost city. This lost city will ultimately take him to 
      the Arabian Peninsula and the vast wasteland of the huge Rub’ al Khali desert, in the search for “Iram of the 
      Pillars”. This game provides the players with multiple perspectives, which means you can play as other players, 
      not just Nate.
