      <div class=Trading>
        <h3>Trading</h3>
        <p>Rocket League has one of the largest platforms for interactive playerbase thanks to its highly popularized trading system. Players can unlock different items in a variety of manners and trade them to obtain their dream car. There are 8 different item rarities:</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="item rarity">Common</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Uncommon</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Rare</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Very Rare</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Import</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Exotic</li>
          <li class="item rarity">BLack Market</li>
          <li class="item rarity">Limited</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Players can unlock items either through crates, tradeups, or trades. Players can win crates through games, but can only open them using a key, which is tradeable on all platforms. Players can unlock anything from rare to black market items in a crate, with a 55% chance of getting a rare item, a 28% chance of getting a very rare item, a 12% chance of getting an import item ,a 4% chance of getting an exotic item, and finally a 1% chance of getting a black market item. <br> Through tradeups, players can use 5 items of the same rarity from the same collection (type of crate) to obtain an item of the next rarity from the same collection. <b> FInally, players can trade all items from uncommon to limited with eachother.</p>

    <div class=Training>
      <h3>Training</h3>
        <p>One of the gamemode on Rocket League where the player can improve their skills alone in a stadium, or practice drills created by Psyonix or by other pros. Furthermore, Rocket League offers their playerbase the option to create their own training sequences covering all aspects of the game. According to Team Ghost Gaming's captain Lethamyr, "Training is what separates grand champs from pros". Grand Champion is the highest rank in Rocket League, but not all grand champs get to participate in tournaments, caused by the lack of time spent in training.</p>
