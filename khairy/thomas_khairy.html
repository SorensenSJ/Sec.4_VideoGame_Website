        <h3><span>Trading</span></h3>
        <p>Rocket League has one of the largest platforms for interactive playerbase thanks to its highly popularized trading system. Players can unlock different items in a variety of manners and trade them to obtain their dream car. There are 8 different item rarities:</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="item-rarity">Common</li>
          <li class="item-rarity">Uncommon</li>
          <li class="item-rarity">Rare</li>
          <li class="item-rarity">Very Rare</li>
          <li class="item-rarity">Import</li>
          <li class="item-rarity">Exotic</li>
          <li class="item-rarity">BLack Market</li>
          <li class="item-rarity">Limited</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Players can unlock items either through crates, tradeups, or trades. Players can win crates through games, but can only open them using a key, which is tradeable on all platforms. Players can unlock anything from rare to black market items in a crate, with a 55% chance of getting a rare item, a 28% chance of getting a very rare item, a 12% chance of getting an import item ,a 4% chance of getting an exotic item, and finally a 1% chance of getting a black market item. <br> Through tradeups, players can use 5 items of the same rarity from the same collection (type of crate) to obtain an item of the next rarity from the same collection. Finally, players can trade all items from uncommon to limited with eachother.</p>

      <h3><span>Casual Game Modes</span></h3>
        <p class=casual-game-modes>Rocket League updated their Casual Game Modes playlist on September 24 2018, switching over Rumble, Dropshot, Hoops, and Snowday to the ranked playlists. The only remaining unranked game modes are casual 3s, 2s, 1s, and 4s. Casual game modes are the perfect opportunity for players to practice their skills without fear of losing rank, as there is nothing to lose after a defeat.</p>

      <h3><span>Training</span></h3>
        <p>One of the gamemode on Rocket League where the player can improve their skills alone in a stadium, or practice drills created by Psyonix or by other pros. Furthermore, Rocket League offers their playerbase the option to create their own training sequences covering all aspects of the game. According to Team Ghost Gaming's captain Lethamyr, "Training is what separates grand champs from pros". Grand Champion is the highest rank in Rocket League, but not all grand champs get to participate in tournaments, caused by the lack of time spent in training.</p>

      <h3><span>Ranked Game Modes</span></h3>
        <p>Ranked Game Modes are by far the most popular game modes in all of Rocket League. This is when players have the opportunity to battle eachother to level up not only their level but also their rank in game. There are 7 different classes of ranks, 3 levels per class (except for grand champion and unranked) and 4 divisions per level. When comparing skill levels, players refer to their ranks as it is the most precise way to measure a player's skill. The different ranks are: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Champion, Grand Champion, and the different icons for each are illustrated on the right. The available ranked game modes are: 1s, 2s, 3s, solo 3s, 3s Dropshot, 3s Rumble, 3s Snow Day, and 2s Hoops.</p>
