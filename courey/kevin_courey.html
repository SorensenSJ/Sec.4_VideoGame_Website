      <h3> WHAT'S THE STORY, MOTHER? </h3>
      <p> The year is 2137, and you will be playing as Amanda Ripley in search of her mother. At the beginning of the game, a human-like robot, which are known as synthetics, named Christopher Samuels, reveals information that is bound to help her, with her search. The flight-recorder unit of the Nostromo, the ship her mother worked on before it disappeared, has been located aboard the Sevastopol space station. Amanda is assigned to retrieve this unit, along with Samuels and a crew-member, named Nina Taylor. They arrive at the Sevastopol, to find the space station damaged, followed by an explosion that separates Amanda from her team. As Amanda tries to find her way back to her friends, she will encounter a different type of synthetic, named Working Joe’s, paranoid and terrified passengers and of course… the Alien. </p>
