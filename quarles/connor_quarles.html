 <h3>What is Tom Clancy's:Rainbow Six Siege?</h3>
  <p>The core of Siege hasn’t changed; a 5v5 dance of attack and defense between well-equipped military special forces squads on compact but complex maps. A wonderful emphasis on strategy and smart play over pure twitch aiming gives it a distinct feel that you don’t get from games like Call of Duty or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Often times figuring out which door to barricade and which to break open can win you more games than just being able to outgun your opponents.</p>
  <p>Each round of a match starts with a frantic race as one side sets up their defenses and the other hunts for intel with remote-controlled drones. It’s game of cat and mouse that often devolves into hilarious, Benny Hilly-style chases as the defenders try to deny the attackers of as much information as possible. It’s only a minute long, but there are a lot of subtle nuances in what walls to reinforce and where to place your traps that can differentiate the good players from the great.</p>

  <p>Most of its levels are set in buildings with three stories, giving its gunfights a sense of height that many shooters lack. They’re also littered with destructible walls and floors, letting you create your own paths with breaching charges or even break small holes in defending walls to create new lines of sight. It makes Siege an immediately more accessible game, empowering you with the ability to improve your win rate through learning the maps alone, even if your aim doesn’t get any better.</p>

 <h3>The History of Siege</h3>
  <p>Rainbow Six Siege had a rough first year. It launched in December 2015 to little fanfare, with the European team cutting their marketing push after a tragic terrorist attack in Paris. The game still picked up plenty of critical acclaim, but didn’t make an impact on the Steam charts.Those that did pick the game up in its first few weeks found their experience marred by a maelstrom of problems, ranging from game-breaking bugs, to the annoying server issues and quirky glitches that seem to come packaged with every multiplayer-only game at launch. The future looked dire.Just over a year later and Rainbow Six Siege has more than 10 million players.</p>

  <p>Rainbow Six Siege represented a bold move for the studio, taking as much from popular multiplayer first-person-shooter Counter Strike as the franchise’s own history. Two teams of five operators – Siege’s different characters, all blessed with a unique selection of weapons and an ability – fight to attack and defend an objective across multiple rounds, with death in a round meaning you are out until the next. This asymmetrical gameplay, paired with procedural destruction that lets gunfights shred the map, was new ground for the series. This shift wasn’t well-received, and before launch there was criticism of the game’s lack of single-player campaign. But once the game was out, word started to spread that not only was Rainbow Six Siege actually good, it was getting better.</p>

 <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
  <p>Rainbow Six Siege’s focus on teamwork and strategy over just aiming prowess sets it apart in exciting ways, and the constant stream of new maps and operators have made it a wonderfully varied FPS. All that new content has made it harder for new players to catch up, and I wish more work had been done to address this, but smart play and good communication will still win you more games than having the newest operator. It’s got some growing pains to sort out, but the future continues to look bright for Siege.</p>
