      <p>This game combines facts with fun. It is a good way to test your knowledge of many different topics as well as learn new things that 
      you may not have already known. Sincw it is the second version it has newer and better questions, making the game still enjoyable even 
      for those people who have played the first version.</p>

         <h2><Strong>Different Trivia Categories</Strong></h2>
  <p>There are five different categories of questions in the game as well as a sixth that allows you to choose a catergory. They are as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>History</li>
      <li>Geography</li>
      <li>Sports</li>
      <li>Arts</li>
      <li>Science</li>
      <li>Crown</li>
    </ol>
      The crown allows you to choose any of the categories you want and if you answer the question correctly you win that category and no more
      of the questions you answer will be on this topic.</p>

      <h3><Strong>How to Play</Strong></h3>
      <p>Playing this game is very straightforward which is one of the reasons why it is so enjoyable. When you press play you will see
      a spinner that you have to click on and that will land on one of the categories. Let's say that it landed on the History button. The
      game will give you the option to answer the question or respin. If you choose to answer it will bring you to a question with four options
      in terms of answers. You choose one of the answer and if you get it right you spin again but if you get it wrong it is either your opponents
      turn or you can pay some of you diamonds to retry. Everytime you get a question right you get one third of a crown. Once you get all three
      pieces of the crown, you get to choose which category you want to answer in. If you answer that questions correctly, as mentioned before,
      you win that category and don't need to answer that category again. Once you complete all five categories you win.</p>
