   <h1>NBA 2k19 Game Review</h1>
   
    <img width="450" height="220"src="http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/f5/52/nba-2k19_1ft1lv76jlgzz1cjerwdyso7k6.jpg?w=1921&h=1080&quality=100&w=960&quality=70">
    <h2>Overview </h2>
   <p>NBA 2K19 shines on the defensive end of the court thanks to tight controls and emphasis on player ratings. It is hard to make the defensive side of things interesting and engaging, but it helps keep NBA 2K19 fun all of the time instead of just half of it. </p> 
    <h2>My Opinion </h2>
    <p>NBA 2K19 is in my opinion a very well made game but there are minor tweaks in the game. For example, the defence from the CPU is almost unbeatable. you cannot run past them and they contest every one of your shots. The good things about this game is that there are a lot of good game modes, like Mypark and Myteam, but the main attention is Mycareer.   </p>
   <h3>Rating</h3>
   <p> 93/100 </p>
